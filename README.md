# About

Hello there üëã,

I am a highly motivated college student interested in software development.

Some of my interests that I thoroughly enjoy include:

- Envisioning solutions to problems üí°
- Learning new things about the technology I use üñ•Ô∏è
- Picking up new technical skills along the way ‚öôÔ∏è

As somebody who takes satisfaction in doing the best they can, I like following tasks through to completion and being part of a team where everybody's contributions fit together to form a high quality product. The opportunity to put my skills to use in a job I enjoy and the prospect of meeting new people both give me the drive to seek to improve my own abilities.

As of right now, some of my goals include learning all aspects of full-stack development, and completing personal projects whilst learning new tools in the process.

Currently, I am studying a T-Level in Digital Production, Design, and Development whilst undertaking work experience at Rolls-Royce.
